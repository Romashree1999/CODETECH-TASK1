===Overview Of the Project===
Project- Simple Calculator
Objective:
----------
User Interaction:
->Learn how to prompt the user for input and read their responses.
->Understand how to handle different types of user input and ensure they are valid.
Arithmetic Operations:
->Implement basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
->Understand the logic behind each operation and how to perform them programmatically.
Conditional Logic:
->Use conditional statements to control the flow of the program based on user input.
->Implement validation to ensure the user enters valid data and handles errors such as division by zero.
Modular Programming:
->Break down the program into smaller, manageable methods to handle specific tasks.
->Learn the importance of code reusability and readability.
Basic Control Structures:
->Use loops to allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
->Understand the use of loops for repetitive tasks and user interaction.
Key Activities:
--------------
Input and Output Handling:
->Gain experience with Java's Scanner class for reading user input.
->Practice displaying messages to the user using System.out.println.
Arithmetic Computation:
->Implement and understand basic arithmetic operations in Java.
->Learn how to manage different data types for arithmetic operations.
Error Handling:
->Implement basic error handling to manage invalid inputs and operations.
->Learn how to prevent and manage runtime errors such as division by zero.
Control Flow:
->Develop a deeper understanding of control flow statements such as if, else if, else, and switch.
->Use loops (while, do-while, or for) to manage repeated actions and decisions.
